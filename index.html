            <h2>Smart Study Skills</h2>
                <div class="skill">The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other.
</div>
                <div class="skill">This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form lasting memories.
</div>
                <div class="skill">Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your own and make it easier to recall them later.
</div>
                <div class="skill">Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things up with Interleaving. 
</div>
                <div class="skill">It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that</div>
                <div class="skill">Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.
</div>
